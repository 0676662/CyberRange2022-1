# Arduino Master

This folder contains the initial copy of the Arduino Sketch for the Adafruit Huzzah32 devices.

This code is configured with the SPIFFS file management code (add/remove/edit files) as well as basic website routes configured.

After duplicating this sketch, create a folder in the repository for your component. Modify the code and routes to add the functionality required.
